# IF4Health Site Management

![](https://if4health.netlify.app/logo/opt-if4health-halfsize.png)

I developed a static webpage for [IF4Health](https://if4health.netlify.app/) Research Group. Thus I decided to create a server to manage published works and students. The idea is to develop CRUDs for both sections - published works and students - while learning a bit of the MERN stack. Go ahead and navigate this repository to check my learning projects out.
